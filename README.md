## 🚀 Overview
**UrbanEye** combines mobile technology, machine learning, and cloud infrastructure to improve urban living.  

The platform provides:
- 📸 Real-time **issue detection** (potholes, traffic, garbage, street lights).  
- 📱 A **Flutter app** for citizens to report and view incidents.  
- ⚙️ A **Node.js backend** with APIs for authentication, feed, and reports.  
- 🧠 **AI/ML models** trained on Roboflow datasets.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- **Android 9–15** (for APK testing)  
- **Android Studio** (for mobile builds)  
- **Flutter SDK**  
- **Node.js + npm**  
- **Python 3.10+** with venv  
- **VS Code / Terminal** for development  

---

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Mobile App
```bash
# Download the APK
Urban_Eye.apk
# Transfer to your Android device
# Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"
# Tap and install
````

### 2️⃣ Backend

```bash
cd Backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning Models

```bash
cd ml
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run modules individually
python app.py
python detect_potholes.py
python garbage_detection.py
python street_light.py
python traffic.py
```

### 4️⃣ Flutter Frontend

```bash
cd Frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 🖼️ Theme

UrbanEye follows a **dark UI** with **neon orange accents** for urgent visibility.

* **Incident Cards** → image thumbnail, severity tag, timestamp, quick actions.
* **Map View** → hotspots & clusters for reported issues.
* **Feed** → social-style posts + citizen reports.
* **Quick Actions** → report, verify, resolve.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **ML models** analyze live camera/video feeds.
2. **Detections** are pushed to the backend API.
3. **Backend** stores and manages reports + user data.
4. **Frontend app** displays the feed, map, and lets users submit reports.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
[ User Device ] -- Flutter App --> [ Backend API ]
       |                                |
       |                                V
       |----> [ ML Models ] ----> [ Database / Storage ]
```

This version is **long, professional, and GitHub-ready** — it sells the project while still being practical for developers.  

Do you also want me to **design a banner graphic** (instead of just shields.io badges) so your README has a visual header?
